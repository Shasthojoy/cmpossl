  OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new,
  OSSL_CRMF_passwordBasedMac_new

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include <openssl/crmf.h>

  int OSSL_CRMF_passwordBasedMac_new(const OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *pbm,
                                     const unsigned char *msg, size_t msgLen,
                                     const unsigned char *secret,
                                     size_t secretLen,
                                     unsigned char **mac, unsigned int *macLen);

  OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new(size_t slen, int owfnid,
                                             long itercnt, int macnid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_CRMF_passwordBasedMac_new() generates a PBM based on the given
OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER.
Expects pointers to the message and the secret to use, and their respective
lengths.  Writes the pointers to the newly allocated MAC and its length into the
respective given parameters.  In the OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER structure, the NIDs
for the OWF (one-way function) and for the MAC (message authentication code) may
be any known to OpenSSL, including NID_hmac_sha1 as mandated by RFC 4210.
Iteration count in the given OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER must be at least 100 as
stipulated by RFC 4211, and can be at most 100000 to avoid DoS through
manipulated or otherwise malformed input.

OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new() initializes and returns a new OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER
structure. Returns
NULL on error.  It generates a random salt with length as given in the slen
parameter.  It copies the algorithms for OWF and MAC as given by their NIDs.
It copies the iterationCount as given, and enforces it to be at least 100.

=head1 NOTES

CRMF is defined in RFC 4211.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_CRMF_passwordBasedMac_new() Returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new() returns a new and initialized OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER
structure, or NULL on error.

=head1 EXAMPLE

OSSL_CRMF_PBMPARAMETER *pbm = NULL;
unsiged char *msg = "Hello";
unsiged char *sec = "SeCrEt";
unsiged char *mac = NULL;
unsiged int macLen;

if ((pbm = OSSL_CRMF_pbmp_new(16, NID_sha256, 500, NID_hmac_sha1) == NULL))
    goto err;
if (!OSSL_CRMF_passwordBasedMac_new(pbm, msg, 5, sec, 6, &mac, &macLen))
    goto err;
